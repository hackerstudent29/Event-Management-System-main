# ✅ STADIUM LAYOUTS standardized - OLYMPIC & SINGLE SOURCE

## Major Updates

    - Oval Track & Field.
    - Distinct segmented stands (VIP, Blocks A-D, North/South Curves).
    - Media & Accessible Zones labeled.
2.  **Universal Labels**: **Every single zone** in all 7 sports (Football, Cricket, Kabaddi, Basketball, Tennis, Hockey, Athletics) now has a distinct, readable text label on the map.
3.  **Simplified Admin UI**: 
    - **Removed "Seating Layout" Dropdown** for Stadium events.
    - Providing a seamless "One Sport = One Layout" experience.
    - Admin simply selects "Athletics" and gets the definitive Olympic Athletics layout immediately.
